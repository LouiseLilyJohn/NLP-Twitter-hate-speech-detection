# NLP-Twitter-hate-speech-detection
Over 800,000 tweets were extracted for this analysis. This research was undertaken to determine if reappropriated LGBTQ+ words are still being used in a negative or positive manner in the tweets. I also attempt to find similarly negative tweets after training the model. The reappropriated LGBTQ+ words used for this research are 'queer' and 'fag'.
Word2vec and Doc2vec embeddings were used to understand the context in which the reappropriated words are used in the tweets.
